all this is for the sake of making progress . ASSUMING THAT YOU HAVE A BIGG GOAL. 

- the people that do not benefit from my success .
> 	which means that our goals are different and any help to them means deviating from your own goal . taking help from them is rare as they are busy with their own shit and that's why its better to maintain a fair distance from their troubles and their celebrations . 

- the people that you haven't figured out or are too unpredictable fall into this category.

how can an outsider win trust and become an insider  ?
1. monil :  helped whenever possible and seeking long term network . 
2. vibhore : available to help with his skills . 

these are clear indications that they are helping me to win even though my progress does not benefit them directly. 
they help when i ask , but also let me know their status and skills , so i know what's their deal .
Me asking help from them is basically the "reverse shourya" where i am not skilled / knowledgeable  enough .
