personality goals 
- no bitching :  many times people get into fights , unprofessional dogs . i intend to stay out of this coz 
	- 1] waste of time 
	- 2] ruins relationships and networks 
- no whining : complaining / crying about the unfair situation ... 
	- 1] unproductive
	- 2] makes u look like a crybaby
- no blaming : blaming the family , friends ,etc. means u assuming that u had no choice.
- no freebies : nobody should be able to tell u to do their work for free. Completely unproductive and irritating . 
- no talking to outsiders : the people that do not benefit from your success are outsiders . 
- improving relations with insiders : helping  the people that benefit you with their success and the people that you benefit with your success
