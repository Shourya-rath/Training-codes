the people that benefit you with their success -> you will pray they win
you benefit them with your success -> they will pray for your win

that's what a team is .

family > mother ,  aunty , brother , uncles 
friends : the ones who are not in my college most likely

this means you make your status info available to them . let them know your battles and they will pray for you

also, there's duty to pray back for them in their own battles . keep yourself updated with their status . 

---
WHEN TO let them know your [[status]]  ???
	- if they are insiders 
	- if you want to see their reaction (can be done with complete strangers - ==purple== and not with known)
	- declare an open challenge [[no haste]]
		- must be with a worthy foe. someone who will make you push to your limits .
		- there is going to be high chance of losing and you must respect this reality . 
	- earn their trust (never with ==orange and red==)
		- to potentially get info from their end
		- to broaden your network
	not when :
	- you want to self certify that you are on the right track(remember that any advice from outsiders is based on their own interests , not for your sake)
	- you have to fill the void
