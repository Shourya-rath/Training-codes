This blog talks about the instance where I learned MPI through group study with kapil.
- There can be multiple approaches and in the "COOLS" they must be noted down
- I'll prrobably write about the approaches I discover for "stuff" in life that will most likely repeat .( most probably in Google DOCS  )

**FACT:** was watching a hitesh choudhary video about "product" vs "project"

**FACT:** Also today there was MPI RTU exam - whole prep was exhaustive and kapil was learning together

**T-O:** I most probably wouldn't have learned MPI - not the same way I learnt it with him. Sure some hours did go to waste , I did not spend time thinking , most of it was going into raw learning - which is why I didn't watch any youtube videos for tutorials. 

> The kind of study where I am constantly supposed to be engaged - talk and not get up .

This had advantage that my mind can't be distracted by daydream or other thoughts.
Disadvantage was that I couldn't watch youtube - so numericals 
and new concepts took a long ass time than they should.

> It is "active" frustating consistency ( Displacement ) *VS*  "passive" cool mental peace  trade off 

// <"passive" cool mental peace> might not be the right word to use here 

What saves Time ? When I know that I Will waste time most probably - I should use the consistent - steady grind approach.

when I am already At Mental Maturity ( when i know that I won't waste time ) - I should choose the way of Mentally Less draining tasks .

- One important thing to be noted is - The consistent Sitting was after 107 page pdf was found.

**COMMENT:** the chapters which had really good notes - We both sat through them and learned from them as deeply as we could- that might not have been possible - Had it been Some Hard Topics like the last ones especially with Unit 3 last ( from control word )Unit 4 and 5 as those two really had diagrams and stuff that one learns better not by practicing , but by watching.

Going over the contents once, I now understand that what parts will be easier using the videos and GNUsim . Which means that there must be 2 steps minimum :
- Step 1 : Go over the Course | part of Course -> recognise what will be hard to learn by just unsufficient notes
- Step 2 : Take the appropriate route - watch videos for numericals , practice by drawing OR just Read Through

Going over the First Control Word of 8255 (we skipped 8259 ICW and OCW) actually made going over other ICs bit easier .

- it's best To know the difference between Learing **VS** mindlessly watching and the mix of two - skipping the mindless to Learn  
> keep Questioning where the stuff is new overall or it builds heavily on previous stuff 

Another approach - possible for DBMS like subject is to prepare pdfs - By summarising Charu's notes OR using GPT pyqs sol OR her assignment - this didn't work very well for MPI because I didn't know MUCH what was in it - so pdf was less helpful. <br>
However in DBMS , Like OOPS I do have a general Idea of every single UNIT. I'll know what needs video and what needs to Read Through . <br>
The answers of chatGPT will be enough to score well in this type of exam . 

The question is -> Should I grind ALL IN ONE OR Should I chip at it slowly . <br>
Read Through part was not there at the end of our sitting with each other - all we did was understand in MPI - there was no Hard notes making . 
If you trust yourself in a comfortable time gap - which rarely happens ; you should go with Videos BUT accountability Boosts Consitency .

As Time is low -> dbms must be Hard Memorised . When there's doubt at self reliance -> ONE must strive / try to create/ replicate "frustation" through active pushing grind ( when job is remaining with Ample Time ) as there is no harm in that , we have realised it . <br>
In case there's almost no time at all remaining . Then the only thing to do is calm down as fast as possible .

Another Example - I am unable to get out of Sleep in the morning , definitely can't do anything that requires me to be Extremely Active and Conscious - I should do something that I will do eventually anyways - TAKE BATH. <br>
I can't shit - So the next thing I do is force myself to do the task I am going to do anyways - This WILL reduce sleep if not eradicate it . <br>
THEN when I am out , I can sleep or do my TASK , nothing lost - posibility of winning increases .
