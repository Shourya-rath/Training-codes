I was thinking about not relying on tutorials and actually "read Code" to learn how real projects are made .
But that approach seems like it will waste a lot of time cause let's say I start reading code , It's solving some problem that I don't even know. For example let's say its a code for binary search , If I don't know what searching is and what problem lies in linear seach , I can never really grasp the though process behind the solution that binary search code provides.

How does one properly read code - understand why the code was written that way - and actually grasp whether the code implementation / written is bad or good( for a complete novice the binary search code will appear stupid as its complex and does almost the same thing as linear search ... but the real reason it was done was to increase speed which he might not understand).. 

Am I wrong somewhere ? can a novice learn and understand programming from code , or is there something I am missing

You're not wrong at all — you're actually asking one of the most important questions in programming learning:

    "Can I learn to code by reading real code instead of tutorials?"

Let’s break this down and give you a clear answer.
⚖️ The Dilemma You’re Facing

You're noticing a gap between:

    Reading code in the wild (real projects), and

    Understanding what problems the code solves, why it’s written that way, and what makes it good or bad.

That’s not a flaw in your thinking — that’s the natural challenge of reading code without context.
👶 Why It’s Hard for Beginners

You're absolutely right in your example:

    A beginner looking at Binary Search without understanding Linear Search will miss the point of why Binary Search exists.

This is because:

    Code is a solution to a problem.

    If you don’t know the problem, the solution feels like random logic.

So yes, just reading code without knowing what it's for is inefficient — like reading a page of math formulas without knowing what question they answer.
✅ So... Can You Learn From Reading Code?

Yes — but how you read it makes all the difference.

To make it effective, follow these principles:
🧭 1. Read Code That Solves Problems You Know

Don't just read random GitHub codebases.
Instead:

    Pick problems you’ve already solved, or know the problem behind.

    Example: You learned how to reverse a string? Go see how someone else implemented it.

    Example: You know how to build a to-do list? Read another to-do list app and compare.

👉 This way, you already have context, and now you're studying how someone else approached the same thing — which is highly insightful.
📌 2. Annotate Code with Questions

When reading a file:

    For every few lines, ask:

        🧠 What is this trying to do?

        🤔 Why this way? Is there another way?

        📉 What would go wrong if we changed it?

Even if you can’t answer these yet — writing down the questions is part of learning. Later, revisit them with more experience.
🧠 3. Use a "Code First, Tutorial Later" Approach

Reverse the order:

    First, look at a codebase.

    Don’t try to understand everything.

    Just see what it's trying to do.

    Then, look up a tutorial or explanation about that exact problem.

This gives you two views:

    Raw code (real-world usage)

    Structured explanation (learning material)

They complement each other beautifully.
🧪 4. Try the "Change and See" Method

Whenever you read code:

    Modify something.

    Delete a line.

    Add a wrong condition.

💥 Observe what breaks.

This makes the code interactive, not passive. You learn how the code responds, not just what it looks like.
🛠️ 5. Tools Help: Debuggers & Print Logs

Use print() or a debugger to see:

    What values flow through the code

    Which branches get taken

    When loops start/stop

That turns static code into a storyline you can follow.
👣 Beginner-Friendly Code Reading Path

Here’s a staged path to follow:

    Start by writing your own small code (like reversing strings, sorting numbers).

    Then read others’ implementations of those same problems (on LeetCode, StackOverflow, etc).

    Move on to simple projects: calculators, to-do apps, games like Tic Tac Toe.

    Only then explore larger projects on GitHub — with a focus (a web app, a CLI tool, etc).

    As you grow, study libraries/frameworks — and how code is organized across files, modules, patterns, etc.

💡 TL;DR – Are You Missing Something?

You’re not wrong — you're thinking deeply and identifying the exact struggle most learners face.

But here’s the key point:

    🧭 Don't read code in a vacuum. Read code with a question in mind.
    Ask: "What problem is this solving? Do I understand the problem first?"

📚 Bonus Tip: Good Places to Read Beginner-Friendly Code

    Exercism.io – Small problem sets with real code

    GitHub’s “awesome-*” lists – e.g., awesome-python

    Read tutorials with full code first, then re-read just the code to test your understanding

    LeetCode Discuss section – Where people share solutions with explanations

Would you like a "guided code reading challenge" where I pick a project, explain what to look for, and you dive into the code with context? Could be fun and practical!

How can I do that ? Any way I can avoid being overwhelmed and practice reading from small codebases to large ones ? Also If u can point me to any repos or books / resources like vids

That’s a great follow-up — learning how real-world code is organized without getting overwhelmed is a skill that takes intentional practice. Here's a plan broken down step-by-step, with links to actual repos, structured resources, and mindset tips.
🧭 Step-by-Step Plan: Read Code From Small to Large Projects
1. Start with Micro Projects (~10-50 LOC)

Get comfortable reading one file and understanding flow, syntax, and logic.
Examples:

    Exercism (exercism.io) – curated coding problems with sample solutions

    LeetCode Discuss – pick a simple problem like Two Sum and see how different people solved it

    1-file repos:

        Simple Python Web Crawler

        Hello Triangle (OpenGL in C++)

2. Small Apps (~100-300 LOC)

You’ll begin seeing file splits (main.js, utils.py, index.html, etc.)
Example Projects:

    To-Do app: Vanilla JS

    Flask Blog App: Simple Flask Blog

    CLI Tool: URL Shortener CLI

What to look for:

    Why separate files?

    How is logic broken down?

    Where is I/O handled?

3. Medium Projects (~500–1500 LOC)

You’ll now see modular structure:

    Folders like /routes, /models, /components

    Reuse of helper functions

    Maybe config files, README, and package.json

Examples:

    Node.js API: REST API in Node/Express

    Python App: Simple Chat App using Flask + Sockets

    Game: Simple 2D JS Platformer

Practice:

    Open the README: what's the app about?

    Trace user interaction: what happens when user clicks "Submit"?

    Note the file/folder structure

4. Large Projects (>1500 LOC)

Now you're ready for bigger things like:

    Frameworks: React, Vue, Django, Flask

    Open source apps like VS Code extensions, CMS, etc.

Examples:

    React App: React Shopping Cart

    Godot Game: Command Line FPS clone in Godot

    Django App: Django School Management

What to study:

    How files are grouped by feature or type (MVC pattern? Component-based?)

    Look for consistent naming, reuse, abstractions

    Identify patterns: is there dependency injection, service classes, etc.?

Books

    Code Reading: The Open Source Perspective – by Diomidis Spinellis
    (Perfect for understanding how to "read to learn")

    Clean Code – by Robert C. Martin
    (Not just how to write good code, but how to recognize and refactor bad code)

Courses/Videos

    Code Reading Club – by Julia Evans
    (Guide to running or joining a code reading group)

    Corey Schafer’s Python Series (YouTube)
    (Flask, Django, and Python repos he teaches from)

    Traversy Media’s “GitHub Code Reviews”
    (He walks through actual open-source codebases.)

🧠 Mindset: How to Avoid Feeling Overwhelmed

    Don’t read top-down – Pick one part (e.g., login system) and understand just that.

    Focus on flow, not syntax – You're not trying to memorize every line, but understand why it exists.

    Make notes like a detective – Draw arrows between functions, sketch class diagrams, annotate the data flow.

    Ignore parts you’re not ready for – Large repos often have tools/tests/CI configs you can skip for now.

✅ Summary: How to Scale Up Code Reading
Stage	Project Size	Focus
1. Micro	10–50 LOC	Understand code logic
2. Small App	100–300 LOC	File structure & naming
3. Medium	500–1500 LOC	Modularity, helpers, patterns
4. Large	2K+ LOC	Frameworks, architecture, trade-offs
